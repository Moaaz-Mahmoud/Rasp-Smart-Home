# Raspberry Pi Smart Home Control

This repository contains the code for a Raspberry Pi-based smart home control system. The system allows you to remotely control lights, door locks, security cameras, and curtains within your home using Raspberry Pi and GPIO.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to create a basic smart home control system using Raspberry Pi and Python. By utilizing GPIO pins, the system can interface with various components to control lights, door locks, security cameras, and curtains.

## Features

- Control lights: Turn lights on/off remotely.
- Lock/unlock doors: Secure your home by remotely controlling the door locks.
- Access security cameras: Monitor your home by accessing the camera feeds remotely.
- Open/close curtains: Adjust the curtains in your home using remote control.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Raspberry Pi board (any model)
- Required components for lights, door locks, security cameras, and curtains (refer to the project documentation for details)
- Python 3.x installed on the Raspberry Pi
- RPi.GPIO library installed (for controlling GPIO pins)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Connect the necessary hardware components to the Raspberry Pi as per the project documentation.
3. Install the required dependencies, including the RPi.GPIO library.
4. Run the `smart_home_control.py` script to start the smart home control system.

## Usage

- Follow the on-screen instructions to control the lights, door locks, security cameras, and curtains.
- Connect physical buttons or switches to the dedicated GPIO pins for controlling the components.
